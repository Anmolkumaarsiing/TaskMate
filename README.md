<h2>üìö DSA Concepts Used In This Project</h2>

Here are some of the DSA concepts used in this project:

* **Sorting Algorithm - Bubble Sort**  
  *Usage*: The function `bubble_sort_tasks(tasks)` sorts the tasks based on their priority level (High, Medium, Low).

* **Hash Map - Dictionary**  
  *Usage*: The dictionary `priority_counts` stores tasks categorized by their priority (Low, Medium, High) in the `task_status_graph` view.

* **List**  
  *Usage*: In the `priority_counts` dictionary, lists store the names of tasks categorized by their priority. Also, in `task_alert`, a list is used to filter and store tasks that are due within the next 24 hours.

* **Greedy Algorithm**  
  *Usage*: Sorting tasks based on the `end_date` to prioritize tasks that are due soon.

* **Queue**  
  *Usage*: Sorting tasks by deadline in the `task_alert` view.

* **Iterative Approach**  
  *Usage*: Iteration is used in functions like `task_status_graph`, where tasks are iterated to sort them by priority or categorize them by their priority level.
